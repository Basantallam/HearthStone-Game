In this project we were applying Object Oriented Programming concepts such as: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritence and Encapsulation in Java.

This was also our very first front end experience. We used Java Swing for the frontend.

In order to run the game open the src folder and choose controller, run the controller java file.
